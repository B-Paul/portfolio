title: color

`color` is a JavaScript color conversion library. I was using this library for an exploratory project, when I realized that a color might shift when setting one of its component color values to the same value multiple times. I introduced a test to demonstrate the bug, then ported the fix that I had applied in my own code to become part of the library.
