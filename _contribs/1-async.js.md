title: Async.js
---

For this popular library, I researched and implemented a function that solved a user's problem with cyclic dependencies becoming deadlocked. I adapted a proven algorithm (Kahn's algorithm) to discover any circular references in the passed object. The community gave supportive comments and cooperation on my pull request and ultimately merged the changes.
