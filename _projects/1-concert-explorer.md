Apps like BandsInTown and Songkick allow you to explore concerts you're likely
to enjoy by searching within a geographic region. With this integration, I
wanted to take that location-based search experience in a new direction by
combining a map view for a spatial presentation. The result is fast, fun
panning and zooming to locate concerts not just in your area, but anywhere
around the globe. I used Ionic to quickly build out the app not only as a
great mobile and desktop web experience, but also as an installable iOS
application.
