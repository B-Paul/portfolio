I started my career in the printing industry, and I'll always retain my
fondness for well-crafted, unique and meaningful printed material. This small
interactive page gives the user a brief, hopefully fun, introduction to some
aspects of the printing process they may not have known about before. The quiz
is built with jQuery and LESS, and performs its animations with ordinary CSS
`@keyframes` rules.
